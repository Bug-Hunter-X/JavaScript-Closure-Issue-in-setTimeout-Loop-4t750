This repository demonstrates a common closure issue in JavaScript when using `setTimeout` within a loop. The code in `bug.js` shows the problem, where all callbacks log 10 instead of the expected 0-9. The solution in `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix this using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) or `let` to create a new scope for each iteration.
